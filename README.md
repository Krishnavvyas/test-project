On click of Get Card, If all the details are valid -> Customer would be navigated to a dummy card status page.

## Coding standards
1. Lazy loading concept has been used.
2. Common component for header nav bar - HeaderDetailsComponent is used across all the pages to access common navigations.
3. Common stylings are placed in style.scss to follow DRY principle.
4. Bootstrap is used for stylings.
5. Unit test for UserLandingPageComponent and HeaderDetailsComponent is written. Note: Due to time contraints complete code coverage isn't achieved.
